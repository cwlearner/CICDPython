# CICD/Python
Repository of basic Python script/scripts that will be used as payload for learning Devops and CICD pipeline things.

Some goals for this will be adding various APIs and deploying it with various programs. The initial goal is deploying it as a docker container in Lambda. An nginx server hosted on Fargate will prompt a sign up using cognito which stores them in a postgres database. Upon logging in a prompt will pop up upon click a button that says "Reveal the Secret Text"
